        <h1>Week 1</h1>
        <h2>Getting started with HTML</h2>
        <p>
            Since 4500, I've learnt a crude understanding of how to interact with asynchronous functions and API
            calls.<br>
            Now, I hope to learn to put together a website - and this step begings with learning some HTML
            formatting.<br>
        <div>
            I've also chosen this rudamentary dark theme because I do much of my work at night, and it's less
            strenuous on my eyes.
        </div>
        <br />
        <text>EDIT: I will reformat and/or remake this page as it grows, this is kind of a catch all for HTML and
            CSS - and maybe some JS for data movement/usage</text>

            CSS
        </h2>
        <p>
            I am now going to use different CSS style sheets with this HTML page to get multiple layouts by only
            changing
            the CSS sheet.
            In my directory, there should be >1 .css file
        </p>

            <br />
            I'm following a youtube tutorial on some web development stuff, and I hope it'll be a good source to get
            well
            versed on this king of work.

                No man is an island,<br>
                Entire of itself,<br>
                Every man is a piece of the continent,<br>
                A part of the main.<br>
                If a clod be washed away by the sea,<br>
                Europe is the less.<br>
                As well as if a promontory were.<br>
                As well as if a manor of thy friend’s<br>
                Or of thine own were:<br>
                Any man’s death diminishes me,<br>
                Because I am involved in mankind,<br>
                And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls;<br>
                It tolls for thee.<br>

            <blockquote>
                Whose woods these are I think I know.<br>
His house is in the village though;<br>
He will not see me stopping here<br>
To watch his woods fill up with snow.<br>
My little horse must think it queer<br>
To stop without a farmhouse near<br>
Between the woods and frozen lake<br>
The darkest evening of the year.<br>
He gives his harness bells a shake<br>
To ask if there is some mistake.<br>
The only other sound’s the sweep<br>
Of easy wind and downy flake.<br>
The woods are lovely, dark and deep,<br>
But I have promises to keep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep,<br>
And miles to go before I sleep.<br>

        <h3>There Will Come Soft Rain - Sara Teasdale</h3>
        <p>
            <blockquote>
                There will come soft rain and the smell of the ground,<br>
                And swallows circling with their shimmering sound;<br>
                And frogs in the pools singing at night,<br>
                And wild plum trees in tremulous white;<br>
                Robins will wear their feathery fire,<br>
                Whistling their whims on a low fence-wire;<br>
                And not one will know of the war, not one<br>
                Will care at last when it is done.<br>
                Not one would mind, neither bird nor tree,<br>
                If mankind perished utterly;<br>
                And Spring herself, when she woke at dawn<br>
                Would scarcely know that we were gone.
