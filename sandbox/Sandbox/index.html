<h1>Week 1</h1>
<h2>Getting started with HTML</h2>
<p>
    Since 4500, I've learnt a crude understanding of how to interact with asynchronous functions and API calls.<br>
    Now, I hope to learn to put together a website - and this step begings with learning some HTML formatting.<br>
    <div>
        I've also chosen this rudamentary dark theme because I do much of my work at night, and it's less strenuous on my eyes.
    </div>

<img src="Hackerman.jpg" style="width:700px;height:400px;" alt="Me IRL">>
</div>

    Week 2

<h2>
    CSS
</h2>
<p>
    I am now going to use different CSS style sheets with this HTML page to get multiple layouts by only changing the CSS sheet.
    In my directory, there should be >1 .css file
